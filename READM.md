# Virtual CPU Simulator 🚀💻

Welcome to the Virtual CPU Simulator, a lightweight CPU simulation written in C++. It emulates a basic CPU with registers, memory, and simple instructions like LOAD, ADD, SUBTRACT, STORE, JUMP, PRINT, and HALT.

Perfect for anyone interested in low-level computing and how CPUs execute instructions!

## 🔥 Features:

Basic CPU Emulation: Emulates the execution of a set of instructions with registers and memory.
Instructions: Includes essential operations such as LOAD, ADD, SUBTRACT, STORE, PRINT, and HALT.
Program Execution: Load and execute programs step-by-step.
Memory and Registers: Supports 4 registers and 16 memory slots.
Simple Syntax: Easy-to-read C++ code for educational purposes.

## 🧠 How It Works:

The virtual CPU simulates a minimalistic processor. It follows a set of instructions to perform operations and manipulate data. Here’s an example flow of how instructions are executed:

### LOAD: Load a value into a register.

### ADD/SUBTRACT: Perform arithmetic operations between registers.

### STORE: Store the value from a register into memory.

### PRINT: Display the value of a register or print a string.

### HALT: Stop the program execution.

Example Program 🚀:
cpp
Copy code
{LOAD, 0, 10, 0}, // LOAD R0, 10
{LOAD, 1, 20, 0}, // LOAD R1, 20
{ADD, 0, 1, 0}, // ADD R0, R1
{PRINT, 0, 0, 0}, // PRINT R0 (which should now be 30)
{STORE, 0, 0, 0}, // STORE R0 to MEM[0]
{HALT, 0, 0, 0} // HALT the program
💡 How To Use:
Clone this repo:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-cpu-simulator.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd virtual-cpu-simulator
Compile and run:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o virtual_cpu main.cpp
./virtual_cpu
⚡️ Example Output:
When you run the program, you'll see something like this:

csharp
Copy code
Loaded string: Hello into Register[0]
Loaded string: World into Register[1]
Register[0] = 30
Register[1] = 20
The virtual CPU performs arithmetic operations, stores data in memory, and prints the results on the console.
